<h1>The Best Movies According to Letchu</h1>

<h2>My top movies/anime of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>

<p>This was the first anime I ever watch and to this day has been one of my favorites. </p>

<h3>Jumanji</h3>

<p>One of my most favorites comedy movies ever. I have watched this movie multiple times when I was travelling on an airplane. And to this day i remember the people close to me looking at me weirdly when I tried to hold my laughter but failed miserably. </p>

<h3>Thuppaki</h3>

<p> Ofcourse I can't leave out a movie from one of my favorite kollywood actors Thalapthy Vijay. Even though I love all his movies good or bad. This one has a special place in my heart because of how it relates to my childhood</p>
